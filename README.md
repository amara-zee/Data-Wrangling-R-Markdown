# Data-wranglig-R-Markdown
I am going to use uber data set here that might be helpful for uber to monitor hot spot areas in terms of where the traffic is flowing.
I am mainly focusing on data within Sydney area, trip duartion, trip fare, trip departure,trip arrival and date as well.
This data can also be helpful to show the profit and comission on each trip with kilometers.
To Run this project please install R markdown.
